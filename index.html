New York City Favorites
</h1>
<p STYLE= "text-align:center ; font-style: italic">
	I’ve visited New York City twice in the past few years, once in the summer and once in the winter. These two seasons in New York make for a vastly different experience, but both have proven to be truly memorable and fun trips. These were a few of my favorite parts:

		<p> From Van Gogh to Monet to Dali to Kahlo, <abbr title="Museum of Modern Art">MoMA</abbr> holds some of the most famous and beautiful art pieces in the world. It was surreal to see paintings like The Starry Night and The Persistence of Memory that I’ve seen and talked about so often right in front of me in real life.</p>

		<p STYLE= "color:#CC6666">The museum recently renovated to make space for displaying more art. They plan to rearrange and use the new space to display more works by people of color and women. <a href="https://www.moma.org/about/new-moma"> Check out the changes they've made</a></p>

	<td><h3 STYLE= "text-align:center ; color:#CC6666">Food</h3>
		<p>One of my favorite parts about New York is the food. A few of my favorites are:</p>
		<ul STYLE= "color:#CC6666">
			<li><em>Wah fung No 1 fast food</em> - This is a carry out restaurant in Chinatown that serves different fresh meats atop rice and cabbage. It’s only <strong>five dollars</strong>, delicious, and very filling. One Yelp reviwer said of Wah Fung: <q>This is as close to an authentic Hong Kong meal that you can find in Chinatown, New York.</q></li>

			<li><em>Buvette</em> - This french bistro in the West Village has a great Sunday brunch bottomless mimosa/coffee option. My friends and I all ordered the Croque-Madame, which was delicious.</li>

			<li><em>Chelsea Market</em> - This is a food/shopping hall that has tons of options to eat at which are all great. My favorite would have to be Los Tacos No. 1, they serve authentic Mexican tacos that are known in the city to be some of the best. (Pictured) 
			</li>

	<td><h3 STYLE= "text-align:center ; color:#CC6666">Staten Island Ferry</h3>
		<p>The first time I went to New York, I didn’t care much to see the Statue of Liberty. However, the next time I went, my friends wanted to see it, so we went on the ferry so that we could get closer to it for free. Although I didn’t think this would be too special, it was. We went during sunset, so on the way to Staten Island, we had a beautiful view of the statue and sunset, and on the way back, we had an amazing view of the lights and skyline. It was another thing in the city that was so surreal to see up close and in person.</p>
